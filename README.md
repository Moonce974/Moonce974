## About Me 🚀

> "Short joke here" 😅

I’m a curious learner exploring different areas of **development** and **project management**.  
Right now, I’m diving deep into **Python** and **C++**, building cool things like:  

- 🕵️ Steganographic tools (hiding data in plain sight)  
- 🤖 AI bots for fun conversations  

🌍 I speak **English** and **French**  
⚡ Fun fact: *I can make computers talk... but they still don’t laugh at my jokes.*
